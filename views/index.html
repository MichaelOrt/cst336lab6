             Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm
             of the Milky Way galaxy. Our solar system consists of
             our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity
             â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
             Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of
             moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Beyond
             our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary
             systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.
