        Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only
        place we know of so far thatâ€™s inhabited by living things.

        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system,
        it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the
        surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest
        of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
